Project Description: Your Teacher - ArabicOCR and NLP Integration for Exam Correction

Overview:
The "Your Teacher" application represents an innovative intersection between Arabic Optical Character Recognition (ArabicOCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a primary goal of automating and enhancing the correction process for exams in Arabic.

Key Features and Technologies:
Utilizing advanced technologies, our project seamlessly integrates with ArabicOCR to detect and extract Arabic words from handwritten exam images. The code employs various libraries and functions, incorporating regular expressions, stop words, and Porter stemming techniques to refine the extraction process. The application also harnesses the power of NLP, specifically text classification, to categorize and analyze exam responses.

OCR Functionality:
In the OCR component, the application efficiently processes images of exams, extracting valuable information to facilitate a streamlined correction process. Handwriting detection and Arabic word extraction are achieved through the implementation of ArabicOCR functions. The system not only identifies textual content but also interprets handwritten responses for accurate evaluation.

NLP and Text Classification:
To enrich the correction process, the project taps into NLP capabilities. Leveraging a dataset of tweets, the text classification functionality enables users to gather insights and opinions. This innovative approach empowers educators and institutions to understand student perspectives and sentiments, contributing to a more comprehensive assessment process.
Benefits:

Efficient exam correction with OCR technology.
Accurate Arabic word extraction for precise evaluation.
NLP-powered text classification for gathering student opinions.
Improved understanding of student sentiments through tweet analysis.
Streamlined and user-friendly interface for educators and institutions.
Conclusion:
"Your Teacher" stands at the forefront of technological innovation, merging ArabicOCR and NLP to revolutionize the exam correction process. By automating tasks traditionally performed manually, the application not only saves time but also provides a deeper understanding of student perspectives, contributing to a more holistic approach to education assessment.
